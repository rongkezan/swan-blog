Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for stars to come out, and then it was nice. It was like just before then sun goes to bed down to the beyou, there was awalys a million sparkles on the water, like that mountain lake, it was so clear, it looked like there were two skies one on top of the other, and then in the desert, when the sun comes up, I couldn't tell where heaven stopped and the earth began, it's so beautiful.
